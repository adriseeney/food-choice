# Food Choice Economics Model

This project explores how various determinants like income, food prices, cultural practices, psychological factors, and government policies influence people's food choices and overall diet quality. It aims to create a simulation model to study how these interconnected factors impact decision-making around diet and nutrition. The focus is not only on economic and policy factors but also on the importance of cultural sensitivity when suggesting healthier dietary alternatives. For instance, how can traditional practices be respected while improving diet quality?

By combining elements from economics, sociology, and behavioral psychology, this model seeks to offer insights into dietary patterns and health outcomes. The simulation uses Python to explore how varying key factors influence food choices, with the goal of identifying pathways to healthier decisions that align with traditional practices.

This repository includes code for developing and testing the model, synthetic data for initial simulations, and detailed explanations of the factors considered. It aims to provide a holistic view of food choice dynamics, helping researchers, policymakers, and practitioners understand and address these challenges more effectively.
